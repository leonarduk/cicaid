## Discussion since your last review
The following PR comments were posted after your last review (oldest first).
Treat them as **pointers**, not as proof. A comment claiming something is "fixed" or
"addressed" does not by itself clear a blocking concern. However, a comment that points
to a specific commit SHA or file:line reference may be treated as evidence the concern
was addressed; verify it against the diff if the relevant block is present. If a blocking
concern is only verbally dismissed with no code reference, you must still REQUEST CHANGES.

The stack is Python 3.x with a CLI built on Click/argparse, distributed as a pip-installable wheel.
Key constraints: preserve CLI backward compatibility, avoid breaking changes to the public Python API,
and ensure all GitHub API interactions respect rate limits and token scopes.

## Linked issue / acceptance criteria
{issue_body}

## PR title
{pr_title}

## Diff (Python, YAML, TOML, Markdown, shell scripts, config files — truncated at 120k chars)
{diff}

If the diff is empty, this is likely a docs-only or config-only PR whose file types
were not captured. In that case, review the PR based solely on the linked issue
acceptance criteria and PR title, and note that no diff was available.
{discussion_section}

Review this PR across these dimensions. Be direct and specific — cite line numbers
or method/class names where relevant. Spend your words on real concerns.

**Omit any section entirely if you have nothing to say about it.**
Do not write "No issues found" or placeholder text for empty sections — just skip them.

### 1. Acceptance criteria
Does the diff satisfy every AC in the linked issue? Call out any gaps explicitly.
If no diff is available, assess whether the PR title and issue description suggest
the work is complete and correctly scoped.

### 2. Bugs and logic errors
Blocking only: incorrect behaviour, unhandled edge cases, resource leaks (unclosed
streams/connections), null-safety violations, swallowed exceptions, thread-safety
issues, or security/data-loss risks. For documentation PRs: factual errors or
dangerously misleading statements.

### 3. CLI and API safety
Blocking only:
- Does the change break any existing CLI command signature or behaviour?
- Are new dependencies introduced without corresponding pyproject.toml changes?
- Are GitHub API calls properly authenticated, rate-limit-aware, and using the correct
  token scopes?
- Are shell subprocess calls safe from injection and properly error-handled?
- Secrets, permissions, or CI assumptions mishandled?

### 4. Test coverage
Are the acceptance criteria exercised by tests or validation steps? Note obvious
missing cases only if they represent a real regression risk.

### 5. Suggested follow-up issues (optional)
For non-blocking improvements (style consistency, missing test coverage, refactor
opportunities, etc.) that are real but should not block this PR: list each as a
one-line suggested GitHub issue title. Do not request changes for these — they
belong in the backlog, not this review.

End with a **verdict line** as the very last line of your review, in exactly this format
(do not add backticks around the verdict, and do not add a list marker such as `-` before it):

- `**APPROVE**` — no blocking concerns (non-blocking items go in section 5 above)
- `**REQUEST CHANGES**` — one or more blocking bugs, security issues, or unmet AC items (list them)

The verdict line must contain nothing but the bold verdict itself, optionally followed
by a short "— explanation" on the same line. Do not use COMMENT as a verdict. If there
are only non-blocking observations, use APPROVE and put them in section 5."""
