"""Detect and close AI-generated issues that are duplicates, already resolved, or
approval artifacts mis-filed as issues.

Continues the a_/b_/.../q_ script chain in scripts/developer_tools/. Scans all
open issues with the ``ai-suggested`` label and flags candidates that are safe to
close because they duplicate another open issue, match an already-closed issue,
or are APPROVE review messages incorrectly filed as standalone issues.

Detection strategies
--------------------
- **LLM-powered** (default, ``--model-source local``): sends the full issue list
  to a local (Ollama) or cloud (DeepSeek) model and asks it to identify slop.
  The model sees both titles and bodies so it can catch near-duplicates, subtle
  APPROVE language, and issues no longer relevant.  Falls back gracefully when
  the model is unreachable.
- **Rule-based** (always on, disable with ``--skip-rules`` or ``--no-llm``): uses
  token-set similarity, regex patterns, and `gh` issue-list queries --- fast,
  deterministic, needs no API key.  Findings from both tiers are merged.

Safety
------
- Defaults to dry-run. Pass ``--yes`` to actually close anything.
- Only ever touches issues with the ``ai-suggested`` label.
- Posts a standardised closing comment explaining the reason before closing,
  so there is an audit trail.
- Idempotent: re-running the same detection produces the same results.
- Candidate issues are deduplicated across detection categories so an issue
  flagged by multiple detectors is only closed once.

Requires the ``gh`` CLI to be authenticated with a token that can close issues
on the target repo.
