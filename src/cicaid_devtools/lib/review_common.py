## Discussion since your last review
The following PR comments were posted after your last review (oldest first).
Treat them as **pointers**, not as proof. A comment claiming something is "fixed" or
"addressed" does not by itself clear a blocking concern. However, a comment that points
to a specific commit SHA or file:line reference may be treated as evidence the concern
was addressed; verify it against the diff if the relevant block is present. If a blocking
concern is only verbally dismissed with no code reference, you must still REQUEST CHANGES.

a family investment management app.

The stack is Python/FastAPI backend + React/Vite TypeScript frontend + AWS Lambda/CDK infrastructure.
Key constraints: preserve portfolio/compliance correctness, keep backend/frontend contracts aligned,
and avoid regressions in CI/deployment workflows.

## Repo-specific context (verified facts — do not raise these as issues)

- **`actions/checkout@v6` and `actions/setup-node@v6` are correct.** Dependabot bumped both from
  v4 to v6 in PRs #2954/#2953; they are the repo-wide convention. Do not flag them as
  non-existent or wrong.
- **`api.getVarBreakdown()` returns camelCase keys** (`varDate`, `varLossPercent`, `scenarios`,
  `breakdown`). The function in `frontend/src/api.ts` transforms the snake_case backend response
  before returning. Test mocks that use camelCase for this function are correct.
- **`recomputeValueAtRisk` is fire-and-forget** in `ValueAtRisk.tsx`. After calling it, the
  component does not re-fetch `getValueAtRisk`; a period change or page refresh triggers the next
  fetch. Tests asserting `getValueAtRisk` is called only once after a recompute are correct.
- **`frontend/package-lock.json` contains Linux-specific optional peer deps** (e.g.
  `@emnapi/core`, `@emnapi/runtime`) that do not appear when the lock file is regenerated on
  Windows. Do not suggest regenerating or normalising the lock file on a non-Linux machine.{verified_facts_section}

{issue_body}

## PR title
{pr_title}

## Diff (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, HTML, config files, shell scripts (.sh), PowerShell scripts (.ps1) — truncated at 120k chars)
{diff}

If the diff is empty, this is likely a docs-only or config-only PR whose file types
were not captured. In that case, review the PR based solely on the linked issue
acceptance criteria and PR title, and note that no diff was available.
{discussion_section}

Review this PR across these dimensions. Be direct and specific — cite line numbers
or function names where relevant. Spend your words on real concerns.

**Omit any section entirely if you have nothing to say about it.**
Do not write "No issues found" or placeholder text for empty sections — just skip them.

### 1. Acceptance criteria
Does the diff satisfy every AC in the linked issue? Call out any gaps explicitly.
If no diff is available, assess whether the PR title and issue description suggest
the work is complete and correctly scoped.

### 2. Bugs and logic errors
Blocking only: incorrect behaviour, unhandled edge cases, off-by-one errors, or
security/data-loss risks. For documentation PRs: factual errors or dangerously
misleading statements.

### 3. API, data, and workflow safety
Blocking only:
- Backend/frontend payload shapes misaligned?
- Could this break local smoke tests, deployment workflows, or repo scripts?
- Secrets, permissions, or CI assumptions mishandled?

### 4. Test coverage
Are the acceptance criteria exercised by tests or validation steps? Note obvious
missing cases only if they represent a real regression risk.

### 5. Suggested follow-up issues (optional)
For non-blocking improvements (style consistency, missing lockfile, refactor
opportunities, test coverage gaps, etc.) that are real but should not block
this PR: list each as a one-line suggested GitHub issue title. Do not request
changes for these — they belong in the backlog, not this review.

End with a **verdict line** as the very last line of your review, in exactly this format
(do not add backticks around the verdict, and do not add a list marker such as `-` before it):

- `**APPROVE**` — no blocking concerns (non-blocking items go in section 5 above)
- `**REQUEST CHANGES**` — one or more blocking bugs, security issues, or unmet AC items (list them)

The verdict line must contain nothing but the bold verdict itself, optionally followed
by a short "— explanation" on the same line. Do not use COMMENT as a verdict. If there
are only non-blocking observations, use APPROVE and put them in section 5."""
